#CnC_Remastered_Collection

Reading this code is pretty amazing experience, CnC is my game of childhood.
Lets try to keep it more new starads friendly.
Also checkout Jason Turner video on YT about this code.

Potential problems
Initialization fields by colon ':'.

Hints:
in the Save/Load system there is always a palce (buffer) for eventualy additional data to keep game compatible after updates.

Code analysis:
- The GUI system is described in GADGET.H
- LIST.H represents linked list implementation.
- VECTOR.H/CPP impelements template vector class, like this one from STL.

ADATA.
AADATA are some unit configuration files.

There is NEW operator overloaded, there is a object pool.
